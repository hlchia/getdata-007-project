# Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

Author: [Chia Hock Lai](https://github.com/hlchia)


## Steps to reproduce this project

    Open the R script run_analysis.r using a text editor.
    Change the parameter of the setwd function call to the working directory/folder (i.e., the folder where these the R script file is saved).
    Run the R script run_analysis.r. It calls the R Markdown file, run_analysis.Rmd, which contains the bulk of the code.

## Outputs produced

    Tidy dataset file tidy_data.txt (tab-delimited text)
    Codebook file codebook.md (Markdown)
